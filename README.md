# The AngelList Experience

ATTENTION! All assets must be scoped under `experience` regardless of the actual
name of the experience.

All assets references should be prefixed with `/assets/experience/`. Any reference
to this path will automatically be converted to a relative `assets/` reference.  It's
the easiest way to keep the engine and the static site playing well together.

When developing, the experience can be accessed through `kumu.dev/experience`.

The static version of the site can easily be served up locally using pow/powder.
Just run `powder link` and the experience will be available via `angellist.dev`.
